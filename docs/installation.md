To get started with this template you need to first, follows instructions of the React Native CLI Quickstart tab from [React Native documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started).

Once your react native environement is setup, you can unzip the package and run the following commands:

```bash
yarn install
```

This command will install all the dependencies needed by this template.

After that you need to setup your local woocommerce website which is included in the package and import all the data which allow you to test the app.
For that you need to have a web server install and setup. In our case we used Wampserver for local development.

Following these steps, you should be able to run our react native e-commerce template using the following command:

```bash
yarn start
```

and inside another terminal run and install the app inside an emulator or a device

```bash
react-native run-android
```

After that our can navigate and explore this template. For get deep understanding of each interface and thus each components which compose
it, you can explore all components inside the API.

These components are organized following each interface and the shared components have their own menu. This way we hope you will be able to
really use this template quickly and correctly.
